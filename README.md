# README: Face Image Generation using GAN

## 1. Dataset Preparation

This section covers the steps required to download and prepare the dataset for training the GAN model.

### Steps:

1. **Install Kaggle Library**: The Kaggle library is installed using `pip install kaggle`.
2. **Upload Kaggle API Key**: The user is prompted to upload the `kaggle.json` file.
3. **Move Kaggle API Key**: The API key is moved to `~/.kaggle/` and permissions are set.
4. **Download Dataset**: The dataset `pretty-face` is downloaded from Kaggle.
5. **Extract Dataset**: The downloaded ZIP file is extracted to a folder.
6. **Verify Dataset**: The extracted files are listed to confirm successful extraction.

## 2. Image Processing

This section involves loading and processing images into a format suitable for training.

### Steps:

1. **Load Image using OpenCV**: A sample image is loaded and displayed using `cv2_imshow`.
2. **Resize Image**: The image is resized to `(256,256)` using OpenCV.
3. **Convert Images to NumPy Array**:
   - Images from the dataset folder are loaded using Pillow (PIL).
   - Images are converted to RGB and resized to `(64,64)`.
   - Images are stored as a NumPy array for efficient processing.
4. **Check Array Shape**: The final dataset shape is printed for verification.

## 3. GAN Model Training

This section covers defining, compiling, and training the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

### Steps:

1. **Define Generator Model**: A deep learning model is created to generate `64x64x3` images from random noise.
2. **Define Discriminator Model**: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is built to classify images as real or fake.
3. **Define GAN Model**: The Generator and Discriminator are combined into a GAN model.
4. **Compile Models**:
   - The Discriminator is compiled using `binary_crossentropy` loss.
   - The GAN is compiled using an Adam optimizer.
5. **Normalize Dataset**: The images are normalized to the range `[-1,1]` for better training.
6. **Train the GAN**:
   - The Discriminator is trained on real and fake images.
   - The Generator is trained to improve image quality.
   - Training progress is displayed every few epochs.
7. **Save and Display Generated Images**: Every few epochs, sample images generated by the GAN are saved and displayed.
8. **Run Training**: The GAN training process is executed for 500 epochs.

### Expected Outcome:

- The model will generate face-like images based on the dataset.
- Over time, the generated images should become more realistic.

## Notes:

- The training process may take around an hour on a T4 GPU.
- Adjusting hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) can improve results.
- Ensure the dataset is properly downloaded before running the GAN training.
